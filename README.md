 Collection of smaller personal projects from high school
 
Name: Silas Wright

Description: This repository is a collection of small personal projects from my time in high school. While, the code could be improved upon and many projects are not incredibly impressive I have decided to keep this repository on display to showcase my mastery of basic coding concepts and the improvement of my abilities overtime thanks to dedication and hard work.

Sorting efficiency program: This program reads from a data file and allows the user to experiment with different sorting algorithms visually showing when certain approaches are more efficient than others, while also demonstrating my knowledge of the algorithms and general Java skills.

Library program: This program is designed to simulate an online library software. The project serves to demonstrate my abilities using java.

Timeline: Projects developed during 2021-2022 (grade 11 and 12 of my high school career)

Usage: Pull the repository or copy source files and run on an IDE of your choice.
